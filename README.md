A little about me: 

Hi, I'm Graziely Tukozaki, but you can call me Grazi. I'm digital marketing especialist at carrer's changing to IT. 
I always loved technology and programming, but i thought that this beautiful (and difficulty) world wasn't for me. 
But all changed last year (2020), like every one, i rethink my life, and asked help to learn web development to my husband, a senior programer. 
With his help, now i self confident to broke barriers and face off every difficult that cross my way.
